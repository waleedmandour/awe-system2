    title: 'The "Salmon Cannon" is the Latest Method for Transporting Fish over Dams',
    originalText: `While hydroelectric dams are able to generate electricity without coal or oil, they act as obstacles for wildlife, and migrating salmon in particular. When salmon are ready to reproduce, they migrate from the sea back upstream into rivers, where they spawn on gravel beds. Swimming upstream requires the ability to fight against obstacles including rapids and up over drop-offs. Yet no matter how well salmon swim, these manmade barriers are often too massive for the fish to cross on their own.

Typically, dams have manmade fish ladders to help fish swim upstream. Water flows over a series of steps, and the determined fish leap up repeatedly, climbing up the steps until they exit into the river at the top of the dam. Unfortunately, at a certain point, some dams are too high and ladders aren't a practical solution. In addition, fish may turn around if the water in a fish ladder is too warm.

Wildlife departments and public utilities already do impractical things to divert salmon past manmade barriers. These include putting them on trucks, loading them onto barges, and in a few cases, lifting them by helicopter. However, the aptly-named company Whooshh Innovations was inspired to solve this problem by looking at their own existing technology invented to transport delicate produce, like ripe tomatoes or apples. The Whooshh system sucks up produce through pressurized tubes and transfers them onto trucks without damage.

If Whooshh tubes could send apples flying over long distances without damaging them, maybe, an employee thought, they could suck fish up and over the dams blocking a river. \"So we put a tilapia in the fruit tube,\" Whooshh's VP Todd Deligan said. \"It went flying, and we were like, 'Huh, check that out.'\" They were able to modify their system to safely give fish a boost, and thus, the salmon cannon was born.

Though the name \"cannon\" is catchy, the device doesn't actually operate like one. Instead, it acts a little like a vacuum cleaner. As a fish enters the system, it immediately whizzes up the tube because the pressure in front of it is lower than the pressure behind it. This differential pressure generates a seal around the fish's middle, holding it steady as the fish speeds along. As the seal lets go of the fish toward the tube's end, the fish slows down. Friction, gravity, and increased water help it decelerate too as it is released into the water.

It took a few years to tweak the design, but Whooshh has developed a system that enables salmon and trout to easily load themselves into the device. The company has also developed a scanner that can automatically sort fish to prevent unwanted species or other objects from travelling through the system. The fish can travel at a speed of 24-35 km/h (15-22 mph) along a track that is misted in order to keep them wet throughout the journey. The current system can transport up to 40 fish per minute.

The tube doesn't appear to increase short-term stress on the fish, according to a 2013 U.S. Geological Survey study, published in the North American Journal of Fisheries Management, that examined the fishes' cortisol levels. Deligan also points out that the cannon speeds up the fish's journey and saves them energy. \"That should translate to a higher return rate of the fish at the spawning grounds,\" he said. So far, Whooshh's cannons have been installed to help fish navigate dams on several rivers in Washington and Oregon. The company hopes that, with continued success, it can expand its business to assist spawning fish in rivers around the globe.`,

        content: `Nitrates (NO3) are chemical compounds made from nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O). The primary toxic effects of the inorganic nitrate ion (NO3) result from its reduction to nitrite (NO2) by microorganisms in the upper digestive tract. The gastrointestinal tract of adults can process this chemical and it naturally passes out of the body through urine, but it can cause a dangerous blood condition in children. High levels of nitrate in food or drinking water are known to be dangerous to babies in the first three months of life, and may result in the so-called "blue baby syndrome". The chemical causes the blood to carry less oxygen, and the infant may suffocate. Other symptoms of nitrite toxicity in children and adults can include difficulty in breathing, dizziness, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. In older children and adults, there is also a risk of cancer because nitrites are unstable and can combine readily with other compound to form nitrosamines, which can cause cancer.`,

        content: `A recent study in the U.S. has said that families using water from wells in agricultural areas should have their water tested regularly to check nitrate levels. The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established that the maximum safe concentration of nitrates in drinking water is 10 mg/l. Yet some wells tested during the study showed levels that were considerably above that limit. Nitrites can build up in groundwater as a result of the excessive use on farms of nitrogen-based fertilizers such as potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate. These chemicals often seep into well water and accumulate there. If wells are found to have nitrate levels that are above the safe limit, it is not advisable to use that water for drinking.`,

        content: `Nitrates are the main form in which the essential plant nutrient, nitrogen, is absorbed naturally by plants from the soil. When fertilizers are added to the soil, the plants can use the nitrates directly and this increases plant growth. Most of the excess nitrates in the environment originate from the chemical fertilizers that are manufactured for agriculture. Unfortunately, in their search for greater profits, farmers often overuse nitrate-based chemical fertilizers to improve crop yields. Vegetables become contaminated with nitrates when crops take up more than they can use for growth. As a consequence, nitrate levels in carrots, lettuce, and spinach, for example, have roughly doubled since the 1970s in the US.`,

        title: 'The Xeros Washing Machine: Cleaning with Nylon Beads Instead of Water',
        content: `Laundry, washing clothes, consumes a large amount of water and energy. The process also produces large amounts of waste water. A UK company, Xeros Ltd., has developed a new kind of washing machine that uses 90% less water to clean clothes. Instead of water, the machine uses a large quantity of nylon beads. These beads are about 3mm long, and look something like grains of rice. The beads, which can be reused hundreds of times, absorb the dirt and stains in clothes.
The idea for this technology came from Stephen Burkinshaw, a chemist at Leeds University who spent 30 years working out how to improve the dyeing of plastics used in fabrics. A few years ago he realized that the stains on clothes acted in a similar way to dyes, and he wondered if he could use plastics to attract away the stains.
He experimented with many kinds of polymers before finding that nylon beads or chips work very well as stain collectors. A natural property of nylon makes it attract to its surface the particles that make up stains. In an environment of 100% humidity, the polymer chains in the nylon beads separate slightly. This makes them super absorbent. The stain particles are then sucked into the centers of the beads.
Working with Xeros Ltd., Burkinshaw developed a washing machine based on his technology. The washing machine looks like a conventional washer. The clothes are placed in the washing compartment and the door is closed. The machine then adds a tiny amount of detergent to help separate dirt from the clothes and a small quantity of water, (360 ml for a commercial machine) to increase humidity. At the same time, several kilograms of nylon beads are released into the washing compartment. The drum rotates, and the beads flow over the laundry for some time. The beads absorb stains and dirt, along with the detergent, as they bounce and rub against the clothes. When the cycle has ended, the machine extracts the beads to be reused. Approximately 99.95% of the beads are removed. The clothes are then removed from the machine and the few remaining beads are shaken or vacuumed off. Clothes are almost completely dry when they come out of the machine. The nylon beads can be reused hundreds of times before they must be replaced. Used beads can then be recycled.
The Xeros washing machine is not yet available to consumers. In the beginning, it will be used in commercial laundries rather than in the home. The first machines should be in use by the end of 2021. 50% of the running costs of commercial laundries comes from water and waste water, and energy costs make up another 30%. Since the Xeros machines use much less water and energy, they should be much cheaper to operate.
People around the world have been washing their clothes in water for thousands of years. The Xeros waterless washing machine has the potential to change that, and thus save huge amounts of water and energy. It is truly a revolutionary product.`,

        title: 'The Environmental Impact of Laundry',
        content: `It takes a lot of water and energy to clean clothes, so the laundry process has a huge environmental impact. Many parts of the world have a shortage of water. This situation is getting worse as human populations increase. Laundry uses a significant part of the available water supply. Even the most efficient commercial washing machines use more than 18 liters of water per kilogram of clothes. In the U.S., more than 18 million cubic meters of water are used for laundry every day. This means more groundwater has to be pumped and more dams have to be constructed. Finally, almost all the water that is used for cleaning clothes is then released as waste water, which requires expensive processing.
Laundry uses energy. First of all, energy is used to produce and purify the water. This is particularly true in places that desalinate ocean water. In addition, approximately 70% of the water used in a commercial laundry is heated, much of it to over 60 degrees C. That requires a lot of energy. A laundry that processes 2000 kg per day would use 36,000 liters. Heating 70% of that amount means heating over 25,000 liters of water. This requires a large amount of energy, and since most energy is produced from fossil fuels, washing clothes releases a large amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. Most laundries and many homes (over 80% in the U.S.) use clothes dryers in addition to washing machines. These use a very high amount of energy, which of course releases large quantities of CO2.
A complex chemical engineering process is required to produce the detergents used in washing machines. These are made up in large part of hydrocarbons which come from oil, although many other chemicals are added to make them effective. A significant amount of energy is needed for these processes. Detergents must also be chemically broken down when, after use, they are released into waste water treatment facilities.
Overall, cleaning clothes uses a large amount of resources and has a significant effect on the environment. A family which washes and dries a load of laundry every two days creates around 440kg of CO2 each year and uses thousands of liters of water. Significant reductions in this consumption could have a very positive effect on the planet.
Since the Xeros does not require a rinse or spin cycle it uses just 2% of the water and energy of conventional washing machines, cutting CO2 emissions on top of the water savings. The energy savings are further increased by the fact that the clothes come out nearly dry, meaning no power-hungry clothes dryer is required. Xeros claims that, taking all these factors into account, its machine achieves a 40% reduction in carbon emissions over conventional washing and drying.`,

dryers: high / none

Operating costs:
water (water to wash clothes): high / 90% lower than conventional
waste water (water that has been used to clean clothes and must be removed): high / 90% lower than conventional
electricity / gas: high: must heat washing water and must operate clothes dryers / much lower; no water heating, shorter washing cycles, no dryers
detergents: high / low: much less detergent is used
plastic beads: none / important cost; necessary for operation but beads can be reused many times

machine maintenance: some cost / similar technology to conventional washers, so similar cost but no dryer maintenance

Overall costs: higher / 30% lower than conventional`,

      title: 'Monopoly: Advantages and Disadvantages',
      content: `A monopoly is a market structure with only one seller of a particular good or service serving many buyers. One of the characteristics of a monopoly is that there is no competition because there is only one single seller in the market. The seller, for example, companies or businesses that control the prices of that particular product or service and dominate the market, is called a monopolist. Unlike in perfectly competitive markets, monopolists control market supply and prices. The monopolist is either a company with a pure monopoly (100%) or one with a monopolistic power (greater than 25%).
There are multiple problems with monopolies. Monopolies are pricier. Because there is no competition, prices may rise. For instance, Microsoft commanded a high price for Microsoft Office throughout the 1980s when it controlled the market for PC software. As a result, consumers pay greater prices and have less available spending money. Besides, lack of competition may encourage organizational slackness and other forms of inefficiency. It is possible for a big firm to become inefficient because it is more difficult to coordinate and communicate in a big organization.
In addition, monopolies frequently possess the authority to pay suppliers less. For instance, farmers have criticized the dominance of big supermarkets, which results in them receiving very little for their goods. A monopoly may also be able to control the wages that its employees get. Companies with monopolies hold power to control the whole market. As a result, they are unable to focus much on the internal welfare of their workforce. They might be persuaded to approach their staff with a low-wage offer.
The undue political advantage is the next disadvantage of monopolies. Particularly with large IT giants that have such sway over society and people's choices, monopolies can amass political power and the capacity to reshape society in an undemocratic and unaccountable manner. Facebook, Google, and Twitter's influence on how information spreads through society is a rising source of worry. Large monopolists like Standard Oil developed a bad reputation in the late nineteenth century for abusing their power and driving competitors out of business.
The most common attribute of a monopoly market is customer exploitation. There aren't any alternatives, which means that the consumer is treated unfairly in terms of availability, value, and cost. Since there are no competing products for the already existing market, the company may find it simple to produce inferior or substandard goods if it so chooses. After all, they are confident that the goods will be purchased.
It's not all bad news, either. The merits of a monopoly are tremendous. Firstly, it is cheap to run. Since there are no near substitutes for the items in question because of their unique nature, the monopolist corporation can differentiate its products without incurring significant marketing and advertising expenses. Furthermore, a single firm can reduce its long-term average expenses in a sector with high fixed costs using economies of scale. For instance, it would be absurd to have numerous small businesses delivering tap water because they would be duplicating infrastructure and financial resources. Having a large-scale infrastructure makes it more effective to have just one firm. Indeed, some services are effectively and efficiently provided by monopolies. It is best to monopolize some services, such as those that are sensitive or security-related, to protect any potentially sensitive information and to preserve its confidentiality.
Additionally, monopoly-holding companies may be the most effective and dynamic. By outperforming their competitors, businesses might acquire monopoly power. For instance, Google has a monopoly on search engines, yet can we conclude that Google is a wasteful company that doesn't try to innovate? It has made significant investments in emerging technologies.
While monopolies can potentially provide improved quality and innovative products, as well as lower costs, it all depends on the choices that they make. They may instead exploit customers with higher prices and falling quantity, along with a limited choice of products.`,

      content: `Marketing refers to the activities a company undertakes to promote the buying or selling of its products or services. Marketing includes advertising and allows businesses to sell products and services to consumers, other businesses, and organizations.
Professionals who work in a corporation's marketing and promotion departments seek to get the attention of key potential audiences through advertising. Promotions are targeted to certain audiences and may involve celebrity endorsements, catchy phrases or slogans, memorable packaging or graphic designs, and overall media exposure. At its most basic level, marketing seeks to match a company's products and services to customers who want access to those products. Matching products to customers ultimately ensures profitability.
Types of Marketing Strategies
Marketing is comprised of an incredibly broad and diverse set of strategies. Though traditional marketing is still prevalent, digital marketing now allows companies to engage in newsletter, social media and content marketing strategies.
Before technology and the Internet revolutionized marketing practices, traditional marketing was the cornerstone of companies' efforts to reach consumers. This encompassed a diverse array of strategies tailored to engage different audiences. Outdoor marketing utilized public displays such as billboards, bench advertisements, vehicle wraps, and transit ads to capture attention in high-traffic areas. Print marketing, characterized by easily replicable materials, was often mass-produced with standardized content, though advancements in printing technology now offer greater flexibility. Direct marketing involved personalized content delivery through mail or distribution of coupons, vouchers, and pamphlets, aiming to establish direct communication with potential customers. Electronic marketing leveraged television and radio to deliver concise digital content, exploiting visual and auditory media to captivate audiences effectively. Event marketing aimed to gather prospective customers in specific locations for product demonstrations or discussions, leveraging conferences, trade shows, seminars, roadshows, and private events as platforms for engagement.
However, nowadays, the introduction of digital marketing has revolutionized the marketing industry, offering innovative ways for companies to connect with customers. Search Engine Marketing involves increasing search traffic through paid placements on result pages or emphasizing search engine optimization (SEO) techniques for organic visibility. E-mail Marketing relies on distributing messages or newsletters to customer email addresses, offering coupons, discounts, or advance sale notices. Social Media Marketing focuses on building an online presence on platforms through paid advertisements or organic growth strategies like posting content and interacting with followers. Content Marketing involves creating free content such as eBooks, infographics, or videos to share information about products, gather customer data, and foster long-term engagement with the company.`,
