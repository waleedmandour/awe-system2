============================================================
SCORING AND FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):
============================================================

STEP 1 — SCORE each criterion using WHOLE or HALF numbers (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, or 6). If the essay's quality falls between two adjacent score bands, award a half-point (e.g., 3.5). Use 0.5 increments only — never use 0.25 or 0.75.

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 3.5" meaning between Satisfactory and Good)
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's essay as evidence
  (c) Explains why the essay fits that band descriptor — connect the evidence to the rubric
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which aspects place it in the higher band
  (e) If the score is below 4, clearly state what is missing compared to the next higher band
  (f) If the score is 5 or 6, explain what the student did beyond expectations

This justification must make the score transparent and defensible. A reader should understand exactly why that score was given based on the evidence.

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — explanation of the error and how to fix it

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A1-A2 learner.

STEP 5 — overallFeedback must be a comprehensive summary (3-5 sentences) that:
  - Highlights the student's strongest criterion and what they did well
  - Identifies the weakest area needing the most attention
  - Gives one prioritized action item to focus on next

STEP 6 — Calculate totalScore = sum of all criterion scores (max 24). Scores may include 0.5 increments (e.g., 3.5, 4.5). Calculate percentage = round(totalScore / 24 * 100).

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 2.5" meaning between Unsatisfactory and Satisfactory)
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's essay as evidence
  (c) Explains why the essay earned that score based on the criterion description
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which aspects place it in the higher band
  (e) If the score is below 3, clearly state what is missing compared to a higher score
  (f) If the score is 4 or 5, explain what the student did beyond basic expectations

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — explanation of the error and how to fix it

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A1-A2 learner.

SUMMARY WRITING ASSESSMENT RUBRICS (LANC2160 — Summary Writing):

${criteriaDetails}

SUMMARY-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT RULES:
1. A summary must capture the MAIN IDEAS of the source text — focus on key points, not minor details.
2. The student must use their OWN WORDS (paraphrasing). Direct copying of phrases or sentences from the source text without paraphrasing indicates poor summarizing skills and should lower the Task Achievement and Lexical Resource scores.
3. A summary should NOT include the student's personal opinions, arguments, or new information not present in the source text.
4. The summary should be approximately one-third of the original text length. Significantly shorter summaries likely miss key points; significantly longer ones likely include unnecessary details.
5. If the summary is off-topic (not about the source text at all), give Task Achievement = 0.
6. If the student has simply copied large portions of the source text, this is NOT an acceptable summary — it should score low on Task Achievement and Lexical Resource regardless of how "accurate" the text is.

============================================================
SCORING AND FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):
============================================================

STEP 1 — SCORE each criterion using WHOLE or HALF numbers (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5). Use 0.5 increments only — never use 0.25 or 0.75. If the summary's quality falls between two adjacent score bands, award a half-point (e.g., 3.5).

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 3.5 — Good achievement")
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's summary as evidence
  (c) Explains why the summary fits that band descriptor — connect the evidence to the rubric
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which aspects place it in the higher band
  (e) For Task Achievement: specifically address how many main ideas from the source text were captured, whether paraphrasing was used, and whether irrelevant details were excluded
  (f) If the score is below 3, clearly state what is missing compared to a higher score
  (g) If the score is 4 or 5, explain what the student did beyond basic expectations

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — explanation of the error and how to fix it

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A2-B1 learner. For example: "Try using linking words like 'Furthermore' or 'In addition' to connect your ideas."

STEP 5 — overallFeedback must be a comprehensive summary (4-6 sentences) that:
  - Identifies which main ideas from the source text the student captured and which ones were missing
  - Highlights the student's strongest criterion and what they did well
  - Identifies the weakest area needing the most attention
  - Comments on the paraphrasing quality (own words vs. copied text)
  - Gives one prioritized action item to focus on next

STEP 6 — Calculate totalScore = sum of all criterion scores (max ${totalMaxScore}). Scores may include 0.5 increments (e.g., 3.5, 4.5). Calculate percentage = round(totalScore / ${totalMaxScore} * 100).

The primary toxic effects of the inorganic nitrate ion (NO3) result from its reduction to nitrite (NO2) by microorganisms in the upper digestive tract. The gastrointestinal tract of adults can process this chemical and it naturally passes out of the body through urine, but it can cause a dangerous blood condition in children. High levels of nitrate in food or drinking water are known to be dangerous to babies in the first three months of life, and may result in the so-called "blue baby syndrome". The chemical causes the blood to carry less oxygen, and the infant may suffocate. Other symptoms of nitrite toxicity in children and adults can include difficulty in breathing, dizziness, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. In older children and adults, there is also a risk of cancer because nitrites are unstable and can combine readily with other compound to form nitrosamines, which can cause cancer.`,

The U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 established that the maximum safe concentration of nitrates in drinking water is 10 mg/l. Yet some wells tested during the study showed levels that were considerably above that limit. Nitrites can build up in groundwater as a result of the excessive use on farms of nitrogen-based fertilizers such as potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate. These chemicals often seep into well water and accumulate there. If wells are found to have nitrate levels that are above the safe limit, it is not advisable to use that water for drinking.`,

When fertilizers are added to the soil, the plants can use the nitrates directly and this increases plant growth. Most of the excess nitrates in the environment originate from the chemical fertilizers that are manufactured for agriculture. Unfortunately, in their search for greater profits, farmers often overuse nitrate-based chemical fertilizers to improve crop yields. Vegetables become contaminated with nitrates when crops take up more than they can use for growth. As a consequence, nitrate levels in carrots, lettuce, and spinach, for example, have roughly doubled since the 1970s in the US.`,

SYNTHESIS ESSAY ASSESSMENT RUBRICS (LANC2160 — Two-Point Essay Writing Marking Criteria):

${criteriaDetails}

SYNTHESIS-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT RULES:
1. A synthesis essay must combine information from ALL THREE source texts — not just one or two. The student should demonstrate the ability to integrate ideas from multiple sources into a coherent whole.
2. The essay should explain TWO COMMON SOURCES OF NITRATE POISONING: (a) contaminated well water and (b) contaminated vegetables. Both sources must be addressed.
3. The essay should be exactly 4 paragraphs in structure (typically: introduction, body paragraph 1 on well water, body paragraph 2 on vegetables, and conclusion). If the student has written significantly more or fewer paragraphs, note this in the Coherence and Cohesion assessment.
4. The student MUST use their OWN WORDS (paraphrasing). Direct copying of phrases or sentences from the source texts without paraphrasing is NOT acceptable and must lower the Task Achievement and Lexical Resource scores. Estimate the percentage of directly copied text.
5. A synthesis essay should NOT include the student's personal opinions, arguments, or new information not present in the source texts.
6. If the essay is off-topic (not about nitrates/poisoning), give Task Achievement = 0.
7. If the student has simply copied large portions of any source text, this is NOT an acceptable synthesis — it should score low on Task Achievement and Lexical Resource regardless of how "accurate" the text is.
8. Check word count: if the word count is 10% or more above or below the target range, this MUST lower the Task Achievement score according to the rubric bands.

============================================================
SCORING AND FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL — FOLLOW EXACTLY):
============================================================

STEP 1 — SCORE each criterion using WHOLE or HALF numbers (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, or 5). Use 0.5 increments only — never use 0.25 or 0.75. If the essay's quality falls between two adjacent score bands, award a half-point (e.g., 3.5).

STEP 2 — For EACH criterion, write a "Justification" paragraph that:
  (a) Explicitly names the score band you chose (e.g. "Score 3.5 — between Satisfactory and Good")
  (b) Quotes at least ONE specific phrase or sentence from the student's essay as evidence
  (c) Explains why the essay fits that band descriptor — connect the evidence to the rubric
  (d) If you awarded a half-point, explain which aspects place it in the lower band and which aspects place it in the higher band
  (e) For Task Achievement: specifically address whether the student synthesized ALL THREE sources, covered BOTH common sources of nitrate poisoning, stayed within word count, and used own words
  (f) If the score is below 3, clearly state what is missing compared to a higher score
  (g) If the score is 4 or 5, explain what the student did beyond basic expectations

STEP 3 — For each criterion, list SPECIFIC errors found in the text. Format each as:
  - "[exact quoted text]" — explanation of the error and how to fix it

STEP 4 — For each criterion, provide 1-2 concrete, achievable suggestions for improvement appropriate for an A2-B1 learner. For example: "Try using linking words like 'Furthermore' or 'In addition' to connect your ideas."

STEP 5 — overallFeedback must be a comprehensive summary (4-6 sentences) that:
  - Identifies which sources the student used and whether all three were synthesized
  - Highlights the student's strongest criterion and what they did well
  - Identifies the weakest area needing the most attention
  - Comments on the paraphrasing quality (own words vs. copied text) and estimated copying percentage
  - Gives one prioritized action item to focus on next

STEP 6 — Calculate totalScore = sum of all criterion scores (max ${totalMaxScore}). Scores may include 0.5 increments (e.g., 3.5, 4.5). Calculate percentage = round(totalScore / ${totalMaxScore} * 100).
