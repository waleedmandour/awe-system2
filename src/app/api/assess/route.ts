Paragraphing is generally appropriate although ideas may not always be supported. Cohesive devices may be over or under used, or used mechanically in places. Text may be repetitive due to lack of referencing.',

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For each criterion, carefully read the rubric descriptors and determine which band best matches the student's performance.
2. Assign a specific score within the band (you may use 0.5 increments between 0-6).
3. Provide detailed, constructive feedback that:
   - Explains WHY the score was assigned using specific language from the rubric
   - Cites specific examples from the student's text
   - Offers actionable suggestions for improvement
4. Calculate the total score as the sum of all criterion scores (max 24).
5. Calculate the percentage as (totalScore / 24) * 100.
6. Calculate an approximate IELTS-style band score (scale of 4-9) based on the overall performance.
